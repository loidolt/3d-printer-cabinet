# 3D Printer Cabinet

Rolling cabinet built to house my plastic and resin printers, and their mess.

## General Info

This cabinet was built to house my two 3D printers, a filament-based printer (Prusa i3 MK3S) and a resin printer (WanHao Duplicator 7). Aside from providing a somewhat tidy place to do my printing work, it also keeps the upper chamber from getting too hot and pumps nasty fumes out of the lower chamber with the resin printer.

I have it vented out the side of the house in its final resting place in the new office.
